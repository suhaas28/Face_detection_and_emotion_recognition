FEATURES:
Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to identify faces in the video stream.
Emotion Recognition: Employs the DeepFace library to analyze and classify emotions into categories such as Happy, Sad, and Angry.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays detected emotions overlaid on the video feed.
TECH_STACK:
Python: The primary programming language for the implementation.
OpenCV: For video capture and image processing.
